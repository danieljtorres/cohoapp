# Adonis-React application

This is an unofficial boilerplate for [AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/) with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend, built from the [official fullstack application boilerplate for Adonisjs](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-fullstack-app)

## Setup

You can manually clone the repo and then run `npm install`, or you can do it the Adonis way:

First, install the cli tool globally:

```bash
npm i -g @adonisjs/cli
```

And then to create a project:

```bash
adonis new <name> --blueprint=MargotDem/adonis-react-app
```

#### Development:
To start developing your app, do:

```js
cd <name>
npm run dev
```

This will concurrently serve your app on localhost:3333 and compile (and watch) the frontend assets
